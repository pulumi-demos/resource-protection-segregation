  ## Commented out this line so users will be prompted to enter the base project name.
  ## Since this is one of the downsides of the inline stack reference approach - there is bookkeeping 
  ## of populating the base project name in the config file, plus the fact that program actually has to know about the
  ## base project and it's outputs.
  ## This is different than the ESC based approach where the program just sees config values and doesn't have to know
  ## about the base project.
